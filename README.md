## Introduction

Deep neural networks often suffer from severe performance degradation when tested on images that differ visually from those encountered during training. This degradation is caused by factors such as domain shift, noise, or changes in lighting.

Recent research has focused on domain adaptation techniques to build deep models that can adapt from an annotated source dataset to a target dataset. However, such methods usually require access to downstream training data, which can be challenging to collect.

An alternative approach is **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)**, which aims to improve the robustness of a pre-trained neural network to a test dataset, potentially by enhancing the network's predictions on one test sample at a time. 


### MEMO
For this project, MEMO was applied to a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network, **ViT-b/16**, using the **ImageNetV2** dataset. This network operates as follows: given a test point $x \in X$, it produces a conditional output distribution $p(y|x; w)$ over a set of classes $Y$, and predicts a label $\hat{y}$ as:

$$
  \hat{y} = M(x | w) = \arg \max_{y \in Y} p(y | x; w) 
$$

</p>

Let $A = \{a_1,...,a_M\}$ be a set of augmentations (resizing, cropping, color jittering, etc.). Each augmentation $a_i \in A$ can be applied to an input sample $$x$$, resulting in a transformed sample denoted as $a_i(x)$, as shown in the figure. The objective here is to make the model's prediction invariant to those specific transformations.

MEMO starts by applying a set of $B$ augmentation functions sampled from $A$ to $x$. It then calculates the average, or marginal, output distribution $\bar{p}(y | x; w)$ by averaging the conditional output distributions over these augmentations, represented as:

$$ 
  \bar{p}(y | x; w) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B p(y | a_i(x); w) 
$$

Since the true label $y$ is not available during testing, the objective of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) is twofold: (i) to ensure that the model's predictions have the same label $y$ across various augmented versions of the test sample, and (i) to increase the confidence in the model's predictions, given that the augmented versions have the same label. To this end, the model is trained to minimize the entropy of the marginal output distribution across augmentations, defined as:

$$ 
  L(w; x) = H(\bar{p}(\cdot | x;w)) = -\sum_{y \in Y} \bar{p}(y | x;w) \log \bar{p}(y | x;w) 
$$

### MEMO_PLUS

We create our version of this implemantation called MEMO_PLUS that  extends the MEMO technique by incorporating additional segmentation masks and processing steps. The masks help the model focus on specific regions of interest in the image, which can further enhance the robustness and performance of the model.

### Implementation Details:

- **Augmentation**: The `apply_augmentations` function is used to generate augmented images from the original input.
- **Meta-Optimization**: The `tune_model` function fine-tunes the model using the augmented images and the specified cost function.
- **Grad-CAM**: The `create_gradcam` function generates heatmaps that visualize the important regions of the input image for the model's predictions.

By using MEMO and MEMO_PLUS, the model becomes more robust to variations and can generalize better to new, unseen data.
